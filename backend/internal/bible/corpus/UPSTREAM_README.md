# KJV Bible JSON Repository

This repository contains the 66 books of the King James Version (KJV) Bible as
chapter-and-verse JSON objects. It is intended to be a transparent,
machine-readable source whose exact contents can be audited and fingerprinted.

## Repository contents

- `*.json` - one UTF-8 JSON file per Bible book
- `kjv.json` - translation identity, history, and repository provenance
- `markers/*.json` - paragraph, added-word, and red-letter rendering DTOs
- `SHA512SUMS` - SHA-512 digest of every exact JSON file
- `script.py` - structural, integrity, marker, and external comparison checks
- `names.py` / `names.ts` - TypeScript filename-list generator and output

## Verify the corpus

Run the complete audit:

```bash
python script.py audit
```

The audit fails if:

- any of the 66 expected books is missing or an unexpected JSON file is present;
- JSON is invalid or contains duplicate keys;
- chapter or verse keys are missing, repeated, non-consecutive, or out of order;
- a verse is empty or is not a string;
- a book's chapter or verse total differs from the published KJV counts; or
- `kjv.json` or a rendering-marker sidecar is malformed or misaligned; or
- an exact-file SHA-512 digest differs from the tracked `SHA512SUMS` manifest.

The manifest can also be checked without Python:

```bash
sha512sum -c SHA512SUMS
```

After intentionally reviewing changes to the Bible JSON, regenerate the
manifest and README corpus fingerprint with:

```bash
python script.py manifest
```

Do not regenerate the manifest merely to silence an audit failure: inspect the
changed verses first.

## Commit quality gate

Install the development checker and enable the tracked Git hook once per clone:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Before every commit, `.githooks/pre-commit` exports the Git index to an isolated
temporary directory and checks that exact staged snapshot. It runs strict
`mypy` checking on the Python utilities and tests, followed by the complete
corpus audit.
The commit fails if typing, JSON structure, any per-book count, the
`SHA512SUMS` manifest, or the README corpus fingerprint is invalid or stale.
This staged-snapshot approach also catches partially staged corpus updates.

Run the same gates manually against the working tree with:

```bash
python -m mypy
python script.py audit
```

Every per-book result produced by `python script.py count` matches the KJV
tables published by
[Bible SuperSearch](https://www.biblesupersearch.com/2019/02/the-number-of-verses-in-the-bible/)
and
[Grace Ambassadors](https://graceambassadors.com/bible/king-james-bible-statistics).

Exact corpus SHA-512:

```text
7c2eff0219d59c683b1d12739a64facb22807770e05daf20cf1a4d22ef1b739d5ec03268abb8c3201fd69eb1014cc45a37697cb8abaceccd316c2e473db0b264
```

The corpus fingerprint is deterministic and covers each canonical filename and
every byte of its file, in biblical order. `script.py` begins with the
domain-separation bytes `KJV-JSON-CORPUS\0v1\0`, then hashes, for each book:
a 4-byte big-endian filename length, its UTF-8 filename, an 8-byte big-endian
file length, and the raw file bytes. Length framing prevents ambiguous
concatenations, and the fixed book order makes the result independent of
filesystem traversal order.

The per-file values in [`SHA512SUMS`](SHA512SUMS) are plain SHA-512 hashes of
the raw files. Together, these fingerprints prove that a copy is byte-for-byte
identical to this tracked snapshot. A hash does **not** by itself prove that
the underlying wording is correct; provenance is established separately below.

## Text provenance

This is a maintained KJV corpus developed and corrected through the
repository's version-control history. It is not stored as a vendor download.
On 2026-07-30 it was aligned verse-for-verse with a temporary comparison
against the Bible SuperSearch `kjv` module, which that provider identifies as
Authorized King James Version, module 6.2.0, year 1611 / 1769. That
identification is a verification reference, not an independent
bibliographical certification or a claim that the repository originated as a
direct copy of that module.

[`kjv.json`](kjv.json) records the translation history, repository provenance,
verification method, and plain-text/marker layout.

Display markup is deliberately separate from verse text. Each
`markers/<Book>.json` sidecar contains a `paragraph_start` flag plus
`added_words` and `words_of_christ` spans for every verse. Span offsets use
Unicode code points and an exclusive end, measured against the corresponding
clean verse string.

## Utility commands

```bash
python script.py count     # validated chapter and verse totals by book
python script.py check     # structure plus scan for embedded verse labels
python script.py hash      # exact-file hashes plus the corpus fingerprint
python script.py audit     # all validation and tracked-manifest verification
python script.py manifest  # intentionally update hashes in SHA512SUMS/README
python script.py credible-check  # temporary whole-provider comparison
```

## Compare against Bible SuperSearch

`script.py credible-check` uses Bible SuperSearch's Bible Download action to
retrieve the complete KJV in **one request**, validates all 66 books and 31,102
verses, removes display markup for comparison, and independently verifies the
66 committed rendering-marker sidecars.

```bash
python script.py credible-check
```

The download and JSON Lines report exist only under ignored `credible/`
temporary storage. If all verse text and marker DTOs match, the command removes
the download, report, and directory completely. If a difference or validation
failure occurs, it retains the temporary evidence for investigation. No
provider Bible payload is committed to this repository.

The regular pre-commit audit is entirely offline. It validates the maintained
corpus, root `kjv.json`, all marker DTO structures and span bounds, tracked
hashes, and the README fingerprint without spending an API request.

To regenerate the TypeScript list of the 66 JSON filenames:

```bash
python names.py
```

## Contributing

Corrections are welcome through pull requests. For any Bible-text change,
please identify the verse, cite the KJV edition or source used, explain the
change, run `python script.py manifest`, and commit the resulting
`SHA512SUMS` update with the JSON change.
